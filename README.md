# Made

Automating tasks like compiling markdown or latex documents can be neatly
handled using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), but you still need to
write the appropriate *Makefile*'s.

*Made* keeps a set of *Makefile*'s for common tasks.


## Installation

    $ sudo make install


## Usage

- List available *Makefile*'s

    $ made -l

- Yank a Makefile

    $ made *{template-name}*
